JULIAN'S LOGBOOK


Problem 1 - MagicSpell
Initial Thoughts: 
I think for this one i can create a second temp string, using this, i can iterativley go through the given characters, storing the A and Z's every time i find one and in the order i find them. Then i just iterate through
this temp string alongside the given spell and each time i encounter an A or Z again in the given spell i just replace it with the A or Z but drawing from the back of the temp, or i could reverse temp and just draw from the front.

Reflections:
This was pretty simple, which would be expected from a warmup question to be fair.


Problem 2 - RugSizes
Initial Thoughts:
For this i think i can start counting up from (1 x area), then (2 x area-1) until i reach area/2, going past that would only create duplicates. I should also check at each iteration if both values are even, and if they
are then i just skip to the next. I will implement this first and see if i need to make any changes from there.
