JULIAN'S LOGBOOK


Problem 1 - MagicSpell
Initial Thoughts: 
I think for this one i can create a second temp string, using this, i can iterativley go through the given characters, storing the A and Z's every time i find one and in the order i find them. Then i just iterate through
this temp string alongside the given spell and each time i encounter an A or Z again in the given spell i just replace it with the A or Z but drawing from the back of the temp, or i could reverse temp and just draw from the front.
