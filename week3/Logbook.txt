Problem 1 - Arrows
Initial Thoughts:
Initially i misunderstood the question and thought it was asking to return the number of arrows not just the longest one. 
Now understanding this, i would say the first step will be to identify the possible arrows (<-, <=, ->, =>), and then possibly iterate through each when found, checking its length. 
I figure that while doing that i can just have another variable called something like longestFound and i can check the length of the arrow we are currently on against the longest so far, updating if necessary.

Reflection:
My first implementation did pretty well however there are two cases i seem to not be handling correcty, which i did expect. Firstly, I am not correctly counting arrows that go from '-' to '=' as that second
character should still be counted as a continuation of the arrow. Secondly i was not counting the arrow head as an arrow so for cases like '<<<<' it was returning 0 instead of 1. These should be simple fixes by changing
how i search for the arrow characters and changing the initial length value on left facing arrows. On the new implementation i was incorrectly count '>' at the end of the right facing arrows. Upon looking at fixing this
i re-read the description and decided to take a slightly different approach. I re-wrote some of the program keeping parts. This new approach makes more sense and should handle these different cases correctly without
adding new functions. I made a super small change fixing the check for updating the length of the current longest arrow, expecting it to only fix 1 or 2 test cases, but ive gotten full marks now so we're good to go.
