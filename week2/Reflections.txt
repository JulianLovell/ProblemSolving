Problem 1 - ChangingString
Initial Thoughts:
I had to re-read the question many times before I think i now understand what it is asking for the problem. 
The first thing that comes to mind is assigning each letter to its corresponding number first and then just working with the numbers instead by returning the A[i] - B[i] for example.
I remember in another class converting letters to numbers using their ASCII values so i might look into doing that.
From there i can find the differences and store these in a vector, then just sort and perform the operation on the K biggest to make their distance 0, which i think is what it is asking.
After doing that i just find the new sum of the distances and return.

Reflection:
So it turns out that C++ inherently represents characters by their ASCII values for math operations, so that means a - b for example can work. I didn't know this, or at least forgot, so that is interesting and helpful.
