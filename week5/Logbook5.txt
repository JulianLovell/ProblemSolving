Problem 1 - Multiples
Design Ideas:
I can just iterate through running a check on each number if it is divisible by 
the given factor. I can then just have a counter that will increase with each successful
check.

Problem 2 - Barbecue
Design Ideas:
Since voter[i] and excluded[i] correlate, i can use a single for loop with both just referencing i.
I don't see any situation where i will need to read voter[i] at the same time as a different value for excluded.
I could probably solve this by setting up a vector like 'vector<int> count(n, 0) and just count how many times each person (index)
get voted for. The only thing left to solve after that would be the cases where it is tied and i need to
eliminate whoever has voted the most. 

Troubleshooting:
My thoughts for the counter cannot work in the way i intended to use it. While troubleshooting 
i thought of a new approach where i can just iterate

Problem 3 - RunLengthEncoding
Design Ideas:
I feel like i can solve this using a single loop. I can iterate through the string,
each time i get to a number i can update a variable called 'multiplyer', then at
the character after i can just print it into a new string 'multiplyer' times. Afterwards
i just return the new string. Then to account for letters without a number in front,
after each print to the new string i can set 'multiplyer' back to 0.

Troubleshooting:
On the first implementation, i was also putting the numbers into the string. This should simple to fix just by using an else statement
after the isdigit() check. Meaning that only things that are't a digit get printed to the new string.
The next issue is that i am not multiplying the number of times elements are being printed. I think this is because i am not converting
the element to an integer, the stoi function should fix this. 
After taking a break since the workshop, looking at my current code again i am seeing some issues. These are my use of the 'stoi' function which won't work in the way i am using it, and i am also not yet checking
if the input is too long. These were straight forward to sort out.
